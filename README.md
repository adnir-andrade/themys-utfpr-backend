# Themys - A TTRPG Assistent (PhP + React Native)

Themys Project is a Tabletop RPG assistent focused on providing players with direct access to essential information about their characters, campaigns, and especially their RPG system rules. The software also aims to allow the Dungeon Master to manage and configure essential aspects of the RPG system, providing utilities and automations that will help any DM to focus more on the campaign itself. The software is aimed at tabletop RPG players and Dungeon Masters who use the Dungeons & Dragons 5 (Next) rule system or homebrews.
